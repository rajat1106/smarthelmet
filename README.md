##
Smart Helmet with sensors for accident preventions using Arduino uno R3. This project consists of three parameters first is the alcohol detection sensor this parameter ensures that if the rider is not drunk while driving the vehicle if the rider has consumed alcohol the bike won't start the second parameter is the helmet worn parameter if the helmet is not worn the bike engine won't start. So both of these parameters have to be true for the engine to start. And the third parameter is the vibration sensor parameter if an accident has occurred the helmet would vibrate and this vibration are detected by the vibration sensors and your GPS location/coordinates are shown on the LCD screen.

1. Install Proteus 8 proffesional & Ardiuno IDE.
2. Download all the files mentioned here.
3. ".ino" files are the code for the microcontrollers which later you have to upload it through Arduino IDE.
4. ".pdsprj" files are the proteus files of both the circuit, in total there are two circuits and three microcontroller used in this project. 
5. I have also uploaded the circuit daigrams so that you can look into it
